# jupyter-micropython-esp32

This notebook introduces MicroPython running on ESP32 based microcontrollers. 

Jupyter Notebook running the MicroPython Remote kernel is used to interact with an ESP32 microcontroller over its REPL interface. An overview of the ESP32 hardware and associated MicroPython libraries is presented. 

MicroPython sample code presented include:
- Control of a LED from GPIO pins.
- Hardware timers.
- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).
- Triggering an LED from a hardware interrupt.
- Introduction to ESP32 Wifi.
- MicroPython upip package manager.
- ESP32 deepsleep.
- Execution of %local notebook cells and interaction with MicroPython remotely.
- Upload scripts to the microcontroller.
